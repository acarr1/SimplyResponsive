        <p>CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about the device being used to access
            the website. For example, it can be used to detect the sixe of the device, its capablities, 
            and its orienatation. For this course, we will be using it to detect the device size, but keep in mind that it is capabl of much more. </p>
